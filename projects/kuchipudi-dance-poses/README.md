# Kuchipudi Dance Poses Documentation

This project documents key Kuchipudi dance poses (asanas and mudras) as a foundation for a future visualization tool. Kuchipudi is a classical Indian dance form known for its grace, storytelling, and intricate footwork.

## Objective
- Document 3-5 iconic Kuchipudi poses with descriptions.
- Plan a tech-based visualization (e.g., using p5.js to animate poses in the future).
- Showcase my cultural expertise as a Kuchipudi dancer while exploring technology.

## Poses
1. **Natuarambham**:
   - **Description**: A starting pose where the dancer stands with feet apart, knees slightly bent, and hands on the hips. It symbolizes readiness and balance.
   - **Cultural Significance**: Often used to begin a performance, setting the rhythm.
2. **Mandakini Pose**:
   - **Description**: One leg is lifted with the foot pointing downward, hands in a mudra (e.g., Hamsasya), depicting a flowing river.
   - **Cultural Significance**: Represents the Mandakini river from mythology, often used in narrative pieces.
3. **Peacock Pose**:
   - **Description**: Arms form a peacock's neck (one hand in Pataka mudra), with a slight tilt of the torso to mimic the bird's elegance.
   - **Cultural Significance**: Inspired by Lord Krishna's association with peacocks, symbolizing beauty.

## Tech Plan
- **Future Visualization**: Use p5.js (a JavaScript library) to create an interactive webpage where users can click to see animations of these poses.
- **Steps**:
  1. Learn basic p5.js through online tutorials (e.g., The Coding Train on YouTube).
  2. Sketch pose coordinates as data points (e.g., x, y positions of hands and feet).
  3. Code animations to transition between poses.

## Next Steps
- Add images or sketches of each pose to this repository.
- Start a p5.js project in a new file (e.g., `sketch.js`) to animate one pose.
- Share this project with dance communities for feedback.
